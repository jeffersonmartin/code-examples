The Laravel MVC basics includes an example of all of the files that you'll need to create for each database table when building a basic Laravel application.

* [Controller](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/app/Http/Controllers/EventTicketController.php)
* [Database Migration](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/database/migrations/2017_09_05_024329_create_event_tickets_table.php)
* [Model](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/app/EventTicket.php)
* [Routes](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/routes/web.php)
* [View - Index](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/resources/views/event/tickets/index.blade.php)
* [View - Create](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/resources/views/event/tickets/create.blade.php)
* [View - Edit](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/blob/master/laravel/mvc-basics/example-code/resources/views/event/tickets/edit.blade.php)

## Laravel Theme Integration

[theme-integration/adminlte](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/tree/master/laravel/theme-integration/adminlte/v2.3.11)

For many applications, you'll want to have a UI that's more advanced than the base Bootstrap style elements. 

[Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/admin-templates) is a website with a gallery of purchasable HTML themes for front-end or admin/back-end applications. With most priced at a reasonable $15-50, they save you a lot of time with having to build your own UI theme that can take tens or hundreds of hours.

If you're looking for free themes, there are a lot of options available (updated August 2017)
* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/)
* [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/)
* [Admin LTE](https://adminlte.io/)
* [Bootstrap Made](https://bootstrapmade.com/)
* [Bootstrap Taste](https://bootstraptaste.com/)
* [Theme Wagon](https://themewagon.com/theme_tag/free/)

Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for, so for personal pet projects using a free theme is fine. If you're getting paid for the work you're doing, you should pay for a theme (or build one yourself).

## Package Scaffolding

[package-scaffolding/](https://github.com/jeffersonmartin/code-examples/tree/master/laravel/package-scaffolding)

The package scaffolding includes an easy-to-navigate folder structure and base files for creating a package in Laravel PHP. This approach of creating folders for each type of file allows you to scale easier when you're working with 10+ database tables in a package.
