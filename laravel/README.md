# Laravel PHP Code Examples

## [Laravel MVC Basics](mvc-basics/)

The Laravel MVC basics includes an example of all of the files that you'll need to create for each database table when building a basic Laravel application.

* [Controller](mvc-basics/app/Http/Controllers/SalesCustomerController.php)
* [Database Migration](mvc-basics/database/2017_08_20_000001_create_sales_customer_controller.php)
* [Model](mvc-basics/app/SalesCustomer.php)
* [Routes](mvc-basics/routes/web.php)
* [View - Index](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/index.blade.php)
* [View - Show](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/show.blade.php)
* [View - Create](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/create.blade.php)
* [View - Edit](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/edit.blade.php)
* [View - Delete](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/delete.blade.php)
* [View - Restore](mvc-basics/resources/views/admin/sales/customer/restore.blade.php)

## [Laravel Themeforest Theme Integration](themeforest-theme-integration/)

For many applications, you'll want to have a UI that's more advanced than the base Bootstrap style elements. 

[Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/admin-templates) is a website with a gallery of purchasable HTML themes for front-end or admin/back-end applications. With most priced at a reasonable $15-50, they save you a lot of time with having to build your own UI theme that can take tens or hundreds of hours.

If you're looking for free themes, there are a lot of options available (updated August 2017)
* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/)
* [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/)
* [Admin LTE](https://adminlte.io/)
* [Bootstrap Made](https://bootstrapmade.com/)
* [Bootstrap Taste](https://bootstraptaste.com/)
* [Theme Wagon](https://themewagon.com/theme_tag/free/)

Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for, so for personal pet projects using a free theme is fine. If you're getting paid for the work you're doing, you should pay for a theme (or build one yourself).

## [Package Scaffolding](package-scaffolding/)

The package scaffolding includes an easy-to-navigate folder structure and base files for creating a package in Laravel PHP. This approach of creating folders for each type of file allows you to scale easier when you're working with 10+ database tables in a package.
